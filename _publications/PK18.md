An architecture for interactive, notebook-based ns-3 simulations in
the cloud is proposed. A prototype implementation of an example study
for IEEE 802.11p inter-channel interference is developed as a
test-case, using direct integration of ns-3 components with Jupyter
via Julia's C++ support. This shows that flexible animations with
advanced visualization of live ns-3 simulation results can be setup
quickly. Although the system appears complex, the benefits of ns-3 as
fast and flexible discrete event simulator complement Julia's
scalability in numerical computing and Jupyter's versatility on the
Web and provide supporting evidence of LiveSim as a promising
direction for multi-modal, reproducible network research.
